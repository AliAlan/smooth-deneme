                A shot that Robert Doisneau took of two people kissing has
                become intrinsically related to Paris – and to romance. Agnès
                Poirier takes a closer look.
              </h3>
              <p>
                IIt is one of the iconic photographs of the 20th Century, an
                image that is synonymous with love and with Paris, the city of
                romance. Its name is Le Baiser de l’Hôtel de Ville (The Kiss by
                the Hôtel de Ville) and an exhibition at the Martin-Gropius-Bau
                in Berlin is currently displaying it alongside another hundred
                or so pictures by the great French photographer Robert Doisneau.
                “People like my photos because they see in them what they would
                see if they stopped rushing about and took the time to enjoy the
                city,” Robert Doisneau used to say. It is very true, however,
                perhaps surprisingly, his most famous picture was staged, says
                Francine Deroudille, Robert Doisneau’s daughter and co-curator
                of the exhibition, as she reveals the story behind Le Baiser de
                l’Hôtel de Ville to BBC Culture. <br /> <br />“The picture was taken in
                the spring 1950. My father’s agent had pitched a series on ‘the
                lovers of Paris’ to American publications and Life magazine had
                commissioned it,” Deroudille explains.
                <br /> 
                <div
                  >Truth here lies in the beauty of the impulse and a
                  spontaneity that is closely linked to the French spirit and
                  its capital city</div
                >
                <br />
                At the time, image rights were already protected by law and a
                cautious Robert Doisneau preferred to use friends or young
                actors to feature in some of his commissioned reportage, in
                order to avoid legal issues. One afternoon in March 1950,
                Doisneau went out into the streets of Paris with young actor
                friends and just let them be: they walked, held hands, talked,
                and kissed, with Doisneau never far behind. “His models weren’t
                models in the sense that they didn’t pose. Doisneau was simply
                catching them flirting and kissing, in a very natural way, ”
                says Deroudille. The result, a kiss caught at the corner of rue
                du Renard and rue de Rivoli right across from the city’s town
                hall, feels like the best of Doisneau: a suspended moment whose
                beauty is known only to the lovers and the photographer. Around
                them, indifferent Parisians walk, hardly noticing the young
                couple; cars shoot by and people seated at a café (now a shoe
                shop) speak animatedly. <br /> <br />
                But, we, sharing Doisneau’s gaze, stop in our tracks in front of
                this picture: the immediacy of it, the young bodies’ movement
                and the place and time, Paris, 1950, cast a spell on the viewer.
                Who cares about authenticity? The sentiments showed in the
                picture are authentic. Truth here lies in the beauty of the
                impulse and a spontaneity that is closely linked to the French
                spirit and its capital city. “At the time, American magazines
                were very keen on Paris stories, especially stories covering the
                life in Paris streets where people behaved much more freely than
                anywhere in America. Even in New York’s streets, couples weren’t
                seen kissing, and certainly never with such carefree abandon,”
                says Francine Deroudille. However, after it was shot, and
                published in Life Magazine, the picture remained just one of
                many in the very large Doisneau portfolio (today totalling
                450,000 negatives, and managed by his two daughters Francine and
                Annette). Doisneau himself didn’t think it such an extraordinary
                picture.

                <h3>
                    Magnolia Blossom is one of series of photographs of flowers and plants Cunningham made in the 1920s.
                </h3>
                 <p> That, in their own quiet way, were revolutionary in approach and execution. In Magnolia Blossom, the flower fills the entire frame. The pistils and stamens are in sharp focus and, through Cunningham’s masterful handling, the petals become a transfixing study of light, shadow, and translucence. It is an unsentimental and, for its time, entirely new approach to familiar and easily-romanticized subject matter.
                    <br><br>
                    This was an important image for Cunningham nearly from the time of its making. It was one of a selection of her images exhibited in the seminal Film und Foto exhibition in 1929, an exhibition which, decades later, continues to define photographic Modernism. It is a testament to the strength of this image that it has endured so resonantly within her oeuvre.
                    <br><br>
                    The print of Magnolia Blossom offered here comes originally from the collection of Maida Glover Gandy, a student at Mills College, where Cunningham’s husband, the artist Roi Partridge taught, and where the Cunningham family lived in the 1920s and ‘30s. It is printed on the warm-toned, matte-surface paper that Cunningham favored at that time. With its distinct surface and long tonal range, the paper is the perfect medium for this photograph, capturing the delicate balance of light and shadow that makes the image such an absorbing visual experience. Early in the 1930s, Cunningham would begin to print on photographic paper with a glossy surface, and later iterations of Magnolia Blossom, while beautifully rendered, present a very different experience of the image.</p>

                <h3>
                    The Americans
                </h3>
                 <p>This is the photo book that redefined what a photo book could be — personal, poetic, real. Now celebrating its 50th anniversary, Robert Frank’s masterpiece still holds up — the selection of photos, and their sequence and pacing is fresh, rich, generous, and stunning. <br><br>

                    And the new 2008 edition published by Steidl offers perhaps the best printing yet, with all new tri-tone scans of the original prints, printed on top quality paper. Robert Frank himself supervised every aspect of this new edition, including approving every page that rolled off the presses. He even re-cropped many of the photos, usually including more of the image than before. <br> <br>
                    
                    Jack Kerouac, the famed Beat Generation poet and novelist wrote the introduction to the first American edition, which came out in 1959, a year after the book was first published in France by Robert Delpire. Kerouac’s text is a perfect complement to the photographs. It has a 1950’s jazz rhythm to it, and wide-eyed innocence and sadness.</p>
                    Kerouac said,
                    <div>
                         “Robert Frank…he sucked a sad poem right out of America onto film, taking rank among the tragic poets of the world.”
